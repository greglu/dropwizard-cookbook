# dropwizard cookbook

Exposes an LWRP for managing [dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/) applications.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greglu/dropwizard-cookbook.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greglu/dropwizard-cookbook)

## Supported Platforms

Creates an [upstart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart#Adoption) init script, so this will work for any OS that supports it, including Ubuntu and CentOS. Will look at expanding to more platforms later.


## Resources and Provider Usage

### `dropwizard` resource

#### attributes

|attribute|required|default|description|
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
|name|**true**||Name of the application. Implied from resource name.|
|path|false|/opt/[name]|Path for the application. Will default into /opt with the application name.|
|user|**true**||System user for running the application.|
|group|false||System group for running the application.|
|jar_file|false|/opt/[name]/[name].jar|Path to your dropwizard application's [fat JAR](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/getting-started/#building-fat-jars) file. It will look into a default path if this isn't set. The default path can be a symlink to your real JAR file, but will depend on your release process.|
|java_bin|false|Output of `which java` or `/usr/bin/java`|Specific `java` command for running the application. Should be set as `#{node['java']['home']}/bin/java` when using the [java cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java).|
|jvm_options|false||JVM options with which to start the dropwizard application. Although there are none set by default, it's highly recommended that you at least set the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` parameters here for defining the Java heap size.|
|arguments|false|server|Arguments to pass after the jar file inclusion. See [Running Your Service](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/getting-started/#running-your-service) in the dropwizard docs for more info. This is where you'd also want to include your YAML config file (don't forget to add `server`!).|
|pid_path|false|/var/run|Directory in which the PID file should be created. By default, creates the file as: `/var/run/[name].pid`|
|init_script_source|false|dropwizard-init.conf.erb|Source template file for which init script to use. Will using this cookbook's [template file](https://github.com/greglu/dropwizard-cookbook/blob/master/templates/default/dropwizard-init.conf.erb) by default, but can be replaced with your own.|
|init_script_cookbook|false|dropwizard|If you change the `init_script_source` attribute, you'll also need to override this one with the name of your own cookbook.|

#### `:install` action

Creates application user, directories, init scripts, and service for the dropwizard application. Check out the `Examples` section of this README for more information.

#### `:delete` action

Removes the directories, init scripts and service for the dropwizard application. Will leave the user intact, though.


#### `:disable` action

Disables and stops the dropwizard application service, but makes no other changes


## Examples

Check out this project's `test/cookbooks/dw_test` directory for an example recipe.

1) Most basic example:

```ruby
dropwizard 'application_name' do
  user 'app_user'
end
```

2) Including a dropwizard config and a few other options:

```ruby
dropwizard node['your_app']['name'] do
  user 'app_user'
  java_bin "#{node['java']['home']}/bin/java"
  jvm_options '-Xms1g -Xmx1g'
  arguments "server #{node['your_app']['config']}"
end

template node['your_app']['config'] do
  source 'your_app-config.yml.erb'
  mode 0644
  owner node['your_app']['user']
  group node['your_app']['group']

  subscribes :create, "dropwizard[#{node['your_app']['name']}]", :delayed
end
```

## Running Tests

Running basic knife tests, foodcritic, chefspec, and rubocop can be done with:

```
$ bundle install
$ rake
```

[test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen) is also used, and can be run with:

```
$ kitchen test
```

To use test-kitchen, make sure you go through the [Getting started](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen#getting-started) instructions first if you haven't done so already.
